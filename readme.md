# Pinyin Helper

I'm currently in the process of learning Mandarin (initially focusing on the pīnyīn, and will be going towards the 汉字 afterwards), thus, instead of going to  baidu baike all the time,i'd just rather have this handy-dandy script with me to answer my questions.

## Packages used:
Streamlit, ggts (Google Text-to-Speech, playsound, translate-python

## References:
